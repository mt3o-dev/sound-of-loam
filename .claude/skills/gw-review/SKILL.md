description: Review an implemented change at the PR gate — code review against plan, standards, and the goal's recalled constraints/invariants, PLUS the memory human gate; assemble the disputed-node checklist, staleness queue, and promotion candidates the human must rule on. Use when a change reaches PR / review time, after /gw-implement or /gw-goal. Trigger phrases: "review the change", "PR review", "/gw-review".

# gw-review

The review boundary is where the two halves of the lifecycle meet the human: the
code (does it match the plan and the standards?) and the graph (what did this
change dispute, and what deserves to outlive it?). The agent surfaces; the human
resolves. That split is the safety model.

## Part 1 — Code review

`/gw-review` runs as a **fresh agent session with a clean context** — it does not
inherit the implementer's memory of what the constraints were. Recall is therefore
not a formality here; it is the only channel through which the change's acceptance
criteria reach the reviewer. Unlike every other recall in the lifecycle (which
loads context to *produce* work), this one loads the criteria to *check finished
work against them*.

Standard 10x-impl-review discipline against `context/changes/<change-id>/`:

1. **Recall the acceptance criteria — mandatory.**

   ```
   recall_context(query="<goal text + the subsystems the diff touches>",
                  goal_ref=<goal_node_id from change.md>)
   ```

   Review the diff against the **settled** `constraint` and `invariant` blocks it
   returns (`tier=lifetime`/`long-term`) — these are the spec the code must
   satisfy. A violated settled constraint is a finding of the same weight as a
   dangerous-decision, not a stylistic note.

   Keep `disputed` blocks out of Part 1: adjudicating a contested constraint
   against the code is re-litigation, which the safety model forbids the agent.
   Note the disputed handles and carry them to Part 2, where the human rules.

2. Diff vs `plan.md`: drift from planned phases, unplanned files touched,
   verification steps skipped. Drift is not automatically wrong — but undisclosed
   drift is.
3. Dangerous-decision scan and repo-standards compliance.
4. Check the plan's `[node:<id>]` references against what was actually built —
   a plan decision silently not honored in code is a finding.

5. **Capture findings that generalize — the lesson channel.** A finding that
   names a class of mistake rather than this diff's instance of it ("services
   must not import from billing", "handlers behind the retrying webhook must be
   idempotent") is lesson material, and the graph is this workflow's lessons.md:
   capture it as a `constraint` or `issue` with `goal_ref`, facets, and an edge
   to what it contradicts or depends on — so the *next* implementation recalls
   it before repeating the mistake. Findings specific to this diff stay in the
   PR text; do not capture instances.

**When the code contradicts a settled constraint — it depends.** Do not resolve
this upfront; the direction is the developer's judgment at the moment it happens:
- the code is wrong and the constraint stands → a code finding (request changes);
- the code is right and the constraint is now obsolete → record `CONTRADICTED`
  (or capture the correcting artifact with a CONTRADICTS edge) and let it flag for
  the Part 2 human gate.

Surface the conflict with both readings and the evidence; never silently pick one.

## Part 2 — Memory review (the human gate)

1. **Collect the queue.** Every node that appeared `disputed` in this change's
   recall bundles, every node the change's own CONTRADICTS links/events flagged,
   plus the store-wide `stale_nodes()` read for anything this change touched.

   Also read the **store-wide** health signal — the total unresolved flag/stale
   count and the age of the oldest one — and report it in the checklist. Call out
   disputes with `NOTED` events showing they **blocked a headless run** — those
   outrank the rest of the queue: work is stalled on them right now. Recall
   only serves the live set, so a queue nobody works rots silently between gates;
   this is the one gate that reliably runs, so it is where queue rot must become
   visible. This is a read-and-report only: the reviewer never clears flags here
   (that is the GUI's human-only action).

2. **Write the checklist into the PR description / review notes:**

   ```markdown
   ## Memory review (human gate)
   Store health: 14 unresolved flags (oldest 23 days). ⚠️ growing — work the queue.

   Disputed nodes touched by this change:
   - [node:<id>] <one-line content> — contradicted by <id/evidence>

   Promotion candidates (CONFIRMED, look durable):
   - [node:<id>] <one-line content> — suggest mid-term → long-term

   Open the review queue: `uv run agentic-memory-gui` → Review tab.
   ```

   The `Store health` line is store-wide, not change-scoped: it makes the standing
   backlog visible at every PR even when this change's own queue is empty.

3. **Tell the human what the GUI offers:** severity plus the rules-resolver
   verdict as a hint, one-click clear for false alarms, tier controls for
   promotions — lifetime promotion requires explicit confirmation there. Every
   human write is journaled, so manual intervention never breaks derived state.

4. **Consolidate the episode (episodic → semantic).** After merge the change's
   un-promoted detail goes dormant — so distill NOW what must outlive it:

   - Capture **one change-summary artifact**: what this change did, the outcome,
     and why — written to be read cold by a future change that recalls this
     territory. Type `concept`, tier `mid-term`, with DEPENDS_ON edges to the
     change's key decision/constraint nodes (so recalling the summary pulls the
     specifics within reach even when they are dormant).
   - Re-read the change's captured artifacts and pick the ones with cross-change
     value: constraints and invariants almost always qualify; decisions qualify
     when a future change could plausibly reverse them unknowingly; narrationish
     leftovers do not.

5. **Suggest, never resolve.** List the change-summary node plus the mid-term
   artifacts that were CONFIRMED and read as durable as **promotion candidates**,
   each with a one-line why. This list is what survives in live recall after the
   sweep — an unpromoted candidate goes dormant with the rest. The human promotes
   in the GUI; the agent never does.

6. An empty queue is a valid outcome — say so explicitly and move on; do not
  manufacture findings.

## Verdict

Close with one of:
- **Approve** — code matches plan/standards, memory queue is presented (empty or
  handed over) → route to merge + `/gw-archive`.
- **Request changes** — findings listed most-severe first, each with the evidence.
  Rework happens under the same change-id; the memory scope stays active. When
  the human's PR feedback reverses or adds a decision during rework, capture it
  (a `decision`, with a CONTRADICTS edge if it overturns a captured one) — human
  feedback is the highest-authority knowledge source in the lifecycle, and a
  rework that changes course without a captured why loses exactly the knowledge
  the next change needs.

## Rules

- Never clear flags, adjust trust/weights, or change tiers — the MCP surface
  cannot, and working around it via the GUI or scripts breaks the model.
- Journal the review itself — one batch covering both parts:
  - `CONFIRMED` **only** for a constraint/invariant the review actively exercised
    (ran its test, traced the path to ground). Review is the strongest source of
    CONFIRMED in the lifecycle; "I read it and it looks right" is not that — that
    is `REVIEWED`. Inflating CONFIRMED at the one gate that fires every PR quietly
    corrupts trust-folding.
  - `REVIEWED` for nodes re-assessed with no new evidence either way (most of
    Part 2). Honest reads feed ranking too.
- Review capacity is the parallelism cap. If the queue of changes awaiting this
  gate grows, stop opening new ones — that is the throughput limit working as
  designed.
