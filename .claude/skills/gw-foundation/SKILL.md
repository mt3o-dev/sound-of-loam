description: Distill the project's foundation documents (PRD, roadmap, tech-stack, architecture decisions) into the memory graph as lifetime-tier candidates, so every future change's recall surfaces them without anyone re-reading the docs. Use after foundation docs are written or amended, and once at adoption time on a project with existing foundation docs. Trigger phrases: "load the foundation into memory", "foundation to graph", "/gw-foundation".

# gw-foundation

Foundation documents are the most cross-change knowledge the project has — which
means files alone are the wrong *retrieval* home for them. The doc stays the
source of truth (holistic, human-readable, git-versioned); this skill extracts its
**normative content** — what future changes must respect, assume, or build on —
into the graph, where goal-dominant recall can serve it at the moment it matters.

The target state: PRD constraints, domain concepts, and tech-stack decisions sit
in the **lifetime/long-term root set** — always live, surviving every change
sweep, ranked into every relevant recall.

## Steps

1. **Open the foundation scope** (once per project):

   ```
   create_change(change_id="foundation", goal="Establish the project's foundational constraints, concepts, and decisions as always-live shared knowledge")
   ```

   If it already exists, recover the goal id from
   `context/foundation/foundation.md` (`memory_goal:` line — create the file if
   missing) and `recall_context` the existing foundation subgraph before touching
   anything.

2. **Distill each document** under `context/foundation/` into artifacts — the
   normative statements, not prose summaries:

   - PRD → `constraint` for every non-negotiable ("invoices are immutable after
     issue"), `concept` for each domain term the project's language depends on,
     `issue` for known accepted gaps.
   - Tech-stack / ADRs → `decision` per choice, with the why in the content
     ("Postgres over SQLite: multi-writer requirement from PRD §3").
   - Roadmap → sparingly: only `constraint`s that sequence work ("payments cannot
     ship before KYC"). Roadmaps churn; the graph should not.
   - Existing `lessons.md` and normative `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` rules (brownfield
     adoption, esp. migrating off plain 10x) → each settled lesson or rule is
     already a cold-readable `constraint` ("the payment webhook retries; handlers
     must be idempotent"); these are among the highest-value distillation targets
     because they encode mistakes the project already paid for. Skip tooling
     boilerplate and anything specific to one file's narrative.
   - The **pre-project intake answers** (`docs/INTAKE`, recorded into
     `context/foundation/` or `CLAUDE.md`) → the normative ones are foundation
     content: facet policy and capture-line as `constraint`s, execution-mode
     routing and promotion authority as `decision`s. Distil them like any other
     foundation doc.
   - The **git workflow** — branching model, PR flow, merge strategy, commit
     conventions — is one of the **first lessons** this pass must capture:
     `decision` per choice, `constraint` for the rules every change must obey
     ("all work lands via PR from a change-id branch; no direct pushes to main").
     Every worktree, headless run, and archive commit acts on these rules; if the
     project has not settled them, stop and settle them with the humans before
     distilling anything else.

   Capture discipline as everywhere: one statement per artifact, readable cold,
   facets from the controlled vocabulary, edges among the foundation nodes
   (a decision DEPENDS_ON the constraint that forced it). Do not capture what
   only matters inside one document's narrative flow.

3. **Reference back.** Note the captured `[node:<id>]`s in the source doc (an
   HTML comment or footer table) so a future amendment session can find the nodes
   its edit invalidates.

4. **Hand the human the promotion list.** Everything captured here is a
   **lifetime-promotion candidate** — that is the entire point; foundation
   knowledge that stays short-term dies with the next sweep. List every node with
   a one-line why; the human promotes in the GUI (lifetime requires explicit
   confirmation there). The agent never promotes.

5. **After promotion**, deactivate the scaffold scope
   (`memory_lifecycle.py deactivate foundation --sweep`) — the promoted nodes
   survive in the root set by design; anything the human declined goes dormant,
   which is the correct verdict recorded.

## Amendments

**Concurrency rule:** amend foundation docs only *between* a change's gates —
never while a planner or implementer is mid-read of them. If an amendment cannot
wait, announce it in every active change's folder (a line in change.md) so the
next gate knows the constraint set moved under the work. The fresh-session gates
(/gw-plan-review, /gw-review) re-read foundation independently and are the
designed safety net for exactly this race — but a net is not a license.

A foundation doc edit is a change like any other: recall the foundation subgraph,
`impact_of` the nodes the edit invalidates (foundation nodes have the widest blast
radius in the store — treat a deep result as a project-level decision), capture
the new statements with CONTRADICTS edges to the superseded ones, and let the
flag → review → re-promotion ladder run. Never edit the store to match the doc
silently.

## Rules

- The doc is the source of truth for *reading*; the graph is the source of truth
  for *being found*. Divergence between them is a bug — fix it through the
  amendment flow, in whichever direction is wrong.
- Lifetime tier is never self-assigned: capture defaults short-term; promotion is
  the human's confirmation that this really is foundation.
- Do not dump documents in whole. A 40-node PRD distillation that recall can rank
  beats one blob node that always ranks or never does.
